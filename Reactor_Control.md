Control of the reactor in Unit #2 differs a bit from Unit #1 as it is more condensed in one place. The operator can either select 'group' control and then to chose which rods he wants to move, or 'all' control, which moves all rods at once with the same switch. Movement speed depends on number of rods selected. The less are selected, the quicker they can be moved. So it is possible to move out single rod groups pretty quickly. This encourages you to play more realistically. In real BWR rods were pulled individually on opposite sides to build initial power. This is due to the fact that BWR tends to be less stable on low powers (due to lack of steam voids). Unit #2 is also less prone to rods imbalance, although high reactivity in a single group can still SCRAM it.

Automatic control can again be used both for rods or circulation control, although as far as rods are concerned it can be chosen to pull all of them or only a selected group. This can be used for example for manual balancing where selected rods can be adjusted manually, while autocontrol can move all to maintain selected reactor power. Be aware that both rods and circulation flow can reach their limit (at 0 or 100%) and at that stage cannot control anymore. You won't be warned about this.
