An Additional Control Room was added specifically for the turbine operations of Unit #2. Please refer to checklists both in the Control Room and in Turbine Control Room on startup procedures. This guide only summarized the features.

Steam sealing control should be used whenever the turbine is rotating, but it requires condenser vacuum and steam available. Sealing should be kept at 0.25 bar with supply and leak off valves. Going out of the limits will reduce efficiency of the turbine and can cause steam leak into the turbine hall.
Oil pumps are provided to provide pressure for both lube and hydraulic oils. Below 1800 RPM auxiliary pumps should be used, above which they should be switched to off, as shaft pump kicks in. During lack of power situations, emergency pumps are provided to be used below 1800 RPM. Pressures should then self maintain around desired levels of 6 bar for lube and 12 bar for hydraulic oils.
Oil heating and cooling is done through heat exchanger supplied by either cool or hot water. Temperature should be kept at all time around 44.8C. Warm oil should also be distributed to the turbine before startup with turning gear switch.
Turbine casing heating should be done while on turning gear before the turbine is started. It requires hot steam from the reactor. In real life this process takes 8 hours but was shortened significantly.
The turning gear can be engaged while the turbine is stationary and then turned on to rotate the turbine. To disengage it, the turbine must come to a complete stop.
Generator cooling should be provided with outside cool air mixed with exaust air if needed (refer to humid air operations checklist)

Before operations make sure that oil valves are open. Startup procedure will require cooperation between both control rooms. Initial oil should be heated and distributed with turning gear, then Control Room needs to provide enough steam temperature for casing heating. With steam available and turbine rotating also, steam sealing must be setup properly. Once all lights, a green Control Room should be notified with turbine ready for run-up. If it can't be started with all green lights, the turbine operator should check the trip bolt at the generator (end of the turbine) and press it if needed.

Lube oil filters can be found in the turbine hall. There are two holders for the filters, one which is used and the other one where filter can be changed. They can be selected with a lever. This device also shows differential pressure. Typical values should be at 0.3-0.4 bar. If higher, a filter might be clogged and require change.
