Turbine control in Unit #2 has been reworked to have also a synchroscope which makes it much more realistic. Now not only you have to keep it very close to 3600 RPM to synchronize it but also keep synchroscope in phase which means the needle close to the top indication. The synchroscope doesn't really matter at lower turbine speeds, and it just rotates randomly, but once you are close to 3600 it will rotate in a given direction: anti-clockwise below 3600 RPM and clockwise above that figure. In order to synchronize you will need to get close to 3600 RPM but stay a few RPM away from this value and keep it there until synchroscope points up. Then you can press sync switch to synchronize with the network. For more precise operations around 3600 additional precision valve was added. It works the same as turbine valve, but in smaller increments.

There is also turbine autocontrol added. It will operate both the turbine valve and the bypass valve to reach certain RPM value (0, 900, 1800, 2700, 3600) with given acceleration rate. This feature can be used to synchronize the turbine automatically when 3600 is selected. It will try to stay just 2 RPM above or below the value to move the synchroscope needle, and then it will try to maintain 3600 RPM.

Also, indicators for turbine vibration and differential expansion were added. At this moment high vibrations can trip the turbine while differential expansion has no influence on the operations. Please refer to the next point on turbine startup procedure.
