Both units are capable of islanding mode, which means that the reactor can self sustain on its own power production when cut off the offsite power. In islanding mode, both main buses (and their pumps) are powered directly from the turbine generator, while it is not synced to the outside network. Turbine speed can vary between 3400-3800 RPM, which provides stable enough current for the buses. Site load induces a certain drag on the turbine depending on the load.

In order to go into islanding mode, generator load has to be reduced below 100 MW and ideally matched equally with site power needs (so power sent to network equals zero). Now the turbine can be desynced. If the load matches site power usage, the turbine will more or less stay around 3600 RPM and requires just a little supervision with the turbine precision valve. If desync is made at higher loads, the turbine would spin up, requiring immediate reduction in turbine valve to maintain the required RPM. Similarly, as desync is made on lower load, the turbine would spin down, requiring additional steam to be provided.

Islanding mode can be prepared if offsite power cut-off is announced in advance. In that case reactor power should be reduced to around 10%, generator load matched with site demand and turbine desynced. Points will be earned exactly as in demand until the event ends, when turbine can be synced back to the offsite. If during the event turbine trips, the reactor will have to be cooled down as in a classical offsite event scenario. In that case 650 points will be awarded minus what has been already earned during islanding.

In Unit 2 Chernobyl like test can also be performed. In order to maintain main bus breakers closed during the test, protection has to be disabled. The turbine would trip at that point, but it will provide power until it spins down to around 300 RPM. Please refer to safety test checklist. In order to successfully complete the test neither startup transformer nor RCIC can be used. Feedwater should be provided thanks to power from running down turbine and once generator power is lost, diesels should be already up for further offline cooling and use of LPCI if needed.
