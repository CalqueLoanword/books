Welcome to realistic Boiling Water Reactor simulator. 

If you are new to this experience, please go to Unit #1. It is here as learning environment. You can access the interactive startup guide and also enable descriptions of the handles (check the wheel button on the right of the screen). Once you are comfortable running the reactor in Unit #1 you can switch to Unit #2 which is basically the same model but in a better looking environment. Unit #2 has some special features, like the synchroscope, and advanced startup procedure, but you should be able to figure out the differences yourself.

As for the simulation, my aim was to make this experience as realistic as possible with very clear indicators and switches. This is not a simulator aimed at blowing up the reactor (there are many such experiences available if that's what you seek). My goal was to make an experience which will teach you the basics of reactor operations and have some fun doing it. Therefore, it is functional in quality, but of course not in quantity. In real plant, every system will have much more subsystems and switches to achieve the same thing.  

Please read this manual carefully to  fully understand BWR operations before you begin. This experience is best played in cooperation of 3 to 4 players. Single player can manage this simulation with use of automatic systems but please be aware that you will earn less points this way. Please join our Discord with any questions ideas and complaints.â—‹
