1) Turn off Offline Cooling Pumps. Residual heat should start building. Turn on polisher and preheaters.
2) Turn on CAR on the condenser panel to initially reduce pressure in the condenser
3) Raise the control rods, bringing the reactor close to critical. Power should read no more than 5% (use IPR indicator for that). Water will start expanding therefore reactor level will raise, but this effect will soon be suppressed by boiling which will reduce reactor water level. While raising rods, refer to selective control to balance reactivities over all groups.
4) Wait until temperature goes over 100 degrees and pressure starts building.
5) Open the bypass flow to maximum to generate steam flow and turn on both SJAE at 100% to reduce pressure in the condenser to 40-70 millibars. You can also start condenser circulation pumps to 10-20%. If reactor pressure is still building above 3000 kPa, and you haven't reached proper condenser vacuum, reduce reactor power.
6) Open Daerator outlet valve to minimum of 50% and constantly maintain proper pressure (1.1-1.6) and temperature (108 C) with inlet valve.
7) Once you have proper vacuum, start the turbine and open the valve a little, but not too much, so the pressure can keep rising. You can also close the bypass now and disable one of the SJAEs. Constantly keep leveling up the flows on Cooling panel. With steam flow, you can also enable automatic cooling control at this stage.
8) You can continue to raise power by pulling rods up to about 10% power on APR. Remember to change IPR setting as the power raises.
9) Observe negative temperature and void coefficient, you will have to pull control rods to maintain power every time when pressure raises.
10) With pressure around 3 MPa and 8% reactor power, it should be enough to smoothly reach 3600 RPM without risk of overshooting. Once the turbine speed nears 3600 close the valve a little bit to slow down the run-up, observe reactor pressure if your reactor power is greater and the pressure goes above 5 MPa use a bypass valve to suppress it. Remember to level up the flows on Cooling Panel and to increase condenser circulation flow as steam flow increases to maintain vacuum.
11) Once the turbine reaches around 3600 RPM and you manage to almost stop at that speed, press the 'Sync' switch. Switch to onsite power and enable both Buses.
12) Once synchronized, increase the power to about 20%-30% and let the pressure raise to about 7MPa. When the pressure and temperature raise, you will face a strong negative feedback from the reactor, so continue pulling rods. When approaching 7MPa open turbine valve more to stop future raise. Remember to level up flows on Cooling Panel and circulation flow on Condenser panel. Try to balance out the reactor by maintaining constant pressure and Reactor Time at infinity. You should generate about 300 MW at that stage.
13) Future power increase should be made with circulation pumps. Start the pumps and increase flows on both circuits to reach the required level for the network demand. Until Xenon levels balance out, you will have to correct reactor power constantly (it will grow on high powers and drop on lower). You can use automatic reactor control.
14) Remember that it's the reactor that dictates power. If demand raises or drops from present level, first change the reactor power with circulation pumps accordingly and only then react with turbine valve to balance pressure at 7MPa. You can use Bypass temporarily, but remember it's wasting steam and fuel.
