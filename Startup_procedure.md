1) Turn off Offline Cooling Pumps. Allow residual heat to start building. Turn on one polisher and all preheaters.
2) Activate the Condenser Auxiliary Relief (CAR) on the condenser panel to initially reduce pressure in the condenser.
3) Gradually raise the control rods, bringing the reactor close to critical. Ensure power does not exceed 5% (use the IPR indicator for reference). As water expands, the reactor level will rise, but this effect will soon be counteracted by boiling, which will reduce the reactor water level. While raising the rods, refer to selective control to balance reactivity across all groups.
4) Wait until the temperature exceeds 100 degrees, and pressure begins to rise.
5) Open the bypass flow to its maximum to generate steam flow and activate both Steam Jet Air Ejectors (SJAE) at 100% to reduce pressure in the condenser to 40-70 millibars. You can also start the condenser circulation pumps at 10-20%. If reactor pressure continues to rise above 3000 kPa, and the desired condenser vacuum is not achieved, reduce reactor power.
6) Initially, open the Daerator outlet valve to a minimum of 50% and maintain proper pressure (1.1-1.6). At this stage, reaching the desired temperature might not be possible.
7) Once you have achieved the proper vacuum, start the turbine and open the valve slightly, avoiding excessive opening to allow pressure to continue rising. You can also close the bypass at this point and disable one of the SJAEs. Continuously adjust the flows on the Cooling panel. With steam flow established, you can enable automatic cooling control.
8) You can gradually increase power by raising the control rods to approximately 10% power on the Automatic Power Regulator (APR). Remember to adjust the IPR setting as the power increases.
9) Monitor the negative temperature and void coefficient, adjusting the control rods as needed to maintain power whenever pressure increases.
10) With pressure around 3 MPa and 10% reactor power, you should be able to smoothly reach 3600 RPM without the risk of overshooting. As the turbine speed approaches 3600 RPM, close the valve slightly to slow down the run-up. Keep an eye on reactor pressure; if your reactor power is higher and pressure exceeds 5 MPa, use a bypass valve to control it. Remember to adjust the flows on the Cooling Panel and increase condenser circulation flow as steam flow increases to maintain vacuum.
11) Once the turbine reaches around 3600 RPM and you can almost stop at that speed, press the 'Sync' switch. Switch to onsite power and enable both Buses. You can use pressure auto-hold at this stage.
12) After synchronization, increase the power to about 20%-30% and allow the pressure to rise to approximately 7MPa. As pressure and temperature rise, you will experience strong negative feedback from the reactor, so continue to adjust the control rods. When nearing 7MPa, open the turbine valve further to prevent further increases. Remember to maintain balanced flows on the Cooling Panel and Condenser Panel. Try to stabilize the reactor by maintaining constant pressure and Reactor Time at infinity. You should generate about 300 MW at this stage.
13) Now, properly set up the Deaerator. Use the inflow valve to reach the desired temperature of 108 degrees and maintain pressure below 1.6 bars with the outflow valve.
14) Future power increases should be achieved using the circulation pumps. Start the pumps and increase flows on both circuits to meet the required network demand. Until Xenon levels stabilize, you will need to adjust reactor power constantly; it will increase at high powers and decrease at lower powers. You can use automatic reactor control.
15) Remember that reactor power determines the overall power output. If the demand increases or decreases from the present level, first adjust reactor power using the circulation pumps accordingly, and then fine-tune the turbine valve to balance the pressure at 7MPa. Temporary use of the bypass is acceptable but keep in mind it wastes steam and fuel.
