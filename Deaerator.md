A deaerator is a device which has two functions. The main function is to remove all non-condensable gases from the condensate (mostly oxygen). The other one is to initially heat feedwater (along with preheaters) so minimum energy is wasted in the reactor on heating while most goes directly into evaporation.

In order to remove gas, water has to be heated to boiling temperature as then possibility of dissolving of gases is minimal. Therefore, deaerator water should be heated to the temperature of around 108 degrees centigrade which is the boiling point at a little higher than atmospheric pressure in the deaerator. Pressure should be maintained between 1.1-1.6 bars.

Deaerator has two main controls for the steam part (the water part is controlled on the cooling panel). The inlet valve dictates how much steam goes into the deaerator, while the outlet valve dictates how much air is rejected outside. The latter valve should be always set at minimum of 50% to assure proper degasification, while the input valve should be used to maintain proper pressure and temperature close to the ideal point of 108 degrees.

Be aware that while most of the deaerator steam condenses back into feedwater some will be ejected along with other gases and wasted (around 1% of inlet flow). Therefore, from time to time some makeup water will have to be injected into the system to balance out the loses.
