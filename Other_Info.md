How to earn points: Check the network demand on the right monitor on supervisor desk. You will have to generate +/-50 MW of power in relation to the demand (after subtracting site power use). If you do so, you will earn 1 point of every second. When using automatic control, you will earn only one point every two or three seconds.

Every piece of equipment repaired will give you 100 points (if you don't mark something wrongly). Going down for maintenance when asked will give you 500 points, while successfully shutting down the reactor in case of offsite power loss will give you 650 points.

Points will grant different ranks.
