        If no local panel operator is present the turbine operator is expected to walkdown the turbien every 10 minutes max interval.  
- Electrical panel:   
        To be monitored by Turbine operator and shift supervisor.
- CST Deaerator and condenser: 1 person.
- Feedwater: 1 person.

## Earning Points

To earn points: Check the network demand on the right monitor on supervisor desk.  
You will have to generate +/-50 MW of power in relation to the demand (after subtracting site power use).  
If you do so, you will earn 1 point of every second.  
When using automatic control, you will earn only one point every two to three seconds.

Every piece of equipment repaired will give you 100 points (if you don't mark something wrongly).  
Going down for maintenance when asked will give you 500 points, while successfully shutting down the reactor in case of offsite power loss will give you 650 points.
