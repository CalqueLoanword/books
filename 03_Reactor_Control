## Reactor Control panel

# Reactor Control

Reactor is controlled primarly by the means of movement of control rods. Rods are pulled out of the core and pushed back inside with Rods Control lever (*in Unit #2 Rods Movement switch*) in either Group Control or All Control. In Group Control only selected rods will move, while in All Control all rods will be move equally. Movement speed can be chosen between S - Slow, M - Medium, F - Fast. In Group Control rods can be moved much quicker and the speed depends also on how many of them are selected.

# Reactor Period

Several indicators are used to control reactor power. The most important indicator is the Reactor Period. Reactor Period tells us in how many seconds power of the reactor will tripple (exactly in how many seconds it changes by the factor of e = 2.71...). Low reactor periods ~ 30 seconds indicate quick changes, large reactor periods ~ 1000 indicate slow changes. When period is at infinity the reactor is at stable constant power. Negative periods indicate power dropping.

At all time positive periods should be held above 30 seconds and reactor will SCRAM if period is below 20 seconds. For high power operations (above 10% of power) much larger periods are recommended 100-500 seconds.

# Source Range

Source Range Monitor (SRM) is used at very low powers during initial reactor startup. This indicator doesn't provide direct reactor power it just counts the neutrons. It should be used up to few thousands of counts when operator should switch to IPR.

# Intermediate Power Range

IPRM (Intermediate Power Range Monitor) consists of a 0-100% gauge and a 6 level selector (*10 levels in Unit #2*). Selector initially should be at level 1 while IPRM is observed. With growing power IPRM will raise and when around 75% (3/4 of the scale) IPRM level should be incremented to level 2. At this moment IPRM will drop to around 30% and will start to raise again. This procedure should be repeated until maximum level is reached. While IPRM doesn't give a direct measurement of reactor power it can be estimated by at which IPR level we are at the moment. Low levels indicate low power, while level 6 (*level 10 for Unit #2) indicates
