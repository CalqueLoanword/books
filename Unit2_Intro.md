Operations of Unit #2

Unit #2 hosts the same type of reactor as unit #1, so the operations are pretty similar. There are however several differences. Unit #2 is still under development, while Unit #1 remains as mostly learning environment and more chill out experience.

Please read this part of the guide to learn about main differences in operating Unit #2. It is strongly advised that you feel comfortable with Unit #1 before switching to Unit #2, as by their nature the indicators are less readable and some of them are not present at all.

In Unit #2 many of the automatic systems can be enabled at all time and many of them won't disable automatically. You have to pay a lot of attention if the actual automatic system can operate in given regime. For example, enabling condenser auto control when there is no steam flow, will result in opening the flow to maximum, which can later induce a problem with severe underpressure. Use your knowledge on how everything works from what you have learned in Unit #1.
