Condensate storage tanks are avaiable for both units, although Unit #2 uses them in higher extent. They can be filled from external source with simple pumps, but be careful not to switch off the startup transformer because they use pretty much of power.

Emergency systems like RCIC and LPCI will use water from condensate storage tanks (only in Unit #2) so be careful not to run dry on them, so be sure to keep at least 50% of their water capacity. On the other hand, don't overfill them, as you won't be able to dump excess water from the system. Both emergency systems come with tank selector (Unit# 2), so you can use any of them or both.

Cooling panel has been reworked to incorporate usage of condensate storage. There is a makeup valve which can be used to fill the Hotwell and a dump valve which can take excess water from the condenser outflow. There is also a makeup pump, but there is no need to use it as long as there is undepressure in the condenser.

While use of the makeup valve is pretty straight forward as it will just fill the Hotwell, the dump valve is a bit more difficult. This valve uses the condenser pump and therefore is a bypass before deaerator. In order to dump the water, both dump valve and condenser pumps must be enabled. Dump valve just takes the percent set from before the deaerator and directs it into storage. If there is no outflow from Hotwell, no water will be taken. If on the other hand the dump valve is at 100% no water will go into the deaerator, no matter the condenser pump setting. In Unit #1 dump valve is simpler and it just drains the hotwell automatically when used.

Assuming that you have balanced flows, in order to decrease Hotwell level you will need to open the dump valve a bit and then increase the condenser valve in order to maintain the deaerator at a given level. In order to decrease reactor level, you would need to open the dump valve and then decrease the feedwater flow to keep deaerator level. That is how it basically works.

Be advised that automatic cooling control will use makeup/dump valves to maintain given setpoints, but you are still able to chose which tank to use.
