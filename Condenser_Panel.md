Condenser circulation panel is used to control the condenser unit. The main idea of this panel is to maintain proper vacuum level (between 40-70 millibars) that will suck steam out of the turbine and let it condense by exchanging heat with circulation flow.

This panel consists of several elements:
- Condenser Air Removal - these are electric pumps that will initially decrease pressure to about 0.85 bar
- Steam Jet Air Ejectors - these are steam driven pumps that will eject uncondensable gasses from condenser, further decreasing pressure. They won't work until the bypass or turbine valve is open and proper steam flow maintained. After that, one should be operated all the time.
- Circulation pumps - these pumps drive the circulation flow which takes water from a nearby lake and pumps it to a heat exchanger in the condenser, which allows steam to cool. When steam cools, it will condensate into water, dramatically decreasing its volume. This will boost vacuum further. Circulation flow should be constantly adjusted to steam flow to maintain the proper level of condensation, which will hold vacuum between 40-70 millibars. Greater pressure than recommended will cause the turbine to trip and may result in a relief valve opening sending uncondensed steam outside the system, while lower pressure will SCRAM the reactor and vent the condenser. Automatic control is possible after reaching proper vacuum level. Turn both pumps on, leave the valve at neutral, and press START. 

The run-up procedure is the following: 
- First start CAR to initially decrease pressure
- At about 5% reactor power when steam is produced, open the bypass valve and enable both SJAE to 100% to decrease pressure
- Enable circulation pump to flow of about 10% to further allow decrease in pressure (this will have real effect with higher steam flows)
- Once proper vacuum is reached, disable one of the SJAE (only one should be used constantly) and maintain vacuum level with circulation flow or enable automatic control (though you will earn fewer points)
- Once proper vacuum level is maintained, turbine can now be started and bypass valve should be closed
- When steam flow changes, circulating pumps should be adjusted accordingly to maintain vacuum within limits.
