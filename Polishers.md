Polisher operations in U2

In the Control Room there is a polisher selector. Only polisher with a green status light should be selected. If polisher with a bypass is selected (red status), the plant should work on minimal power for a limited time (points penalty aplied). Changing active polishers should be coordinated with the polisher operator.

In the condenser hall, there is a polisher operating panel. Each polisher consists of a bypass valve, which should be activated before any activity is done (coordinate this first with the control room). Each polisher also has a recirculation valve and recirculation pump, which can be used to check polisher quality by measuring conductivity (33-35 uSm/cm is the normal output, a polisher can be used up to 60 uSm/cm, above that, random pump trips can happen). Each polisher also has a filter which quality can be measured with differential pressure (anything above 3 bars can cause pump trips). Conductivity and differential pressure can also be checked when the polisher is operating with condensate water.

In order to clean the polisher, an empty tank (3 are available) should be selected by proper setting of the valves, and then both water and air flush should be initiated in sequence (buttons near polisher symbol, each step takes 3 minutes). When the polisher is empty, a tank with new resin should be selected by the proper setting of the valves, and the tank button should be pressed. This will transfer new resin into the polisher. When this process is done, recirculation should be started to check polisher condition, and finally, bypass should be disabled and Control Room advised that the given polisher is ready.

Old resin in a tank can be regenerated by pressing a button on the tank control. The whole process takes approximately 15 minutes and is fully automatic. Once regeneration is done, new resin will be available for use.

Polisher diodes: red - empty, green - operational, green flashing - resin is being refilled, yellow - awaiting air flush, yellow flashing - resin being ejected.
Tank diodes: red - empty, red flashing - resin is being loaded, yellow - awaiting regeneration, yellow flashing - regenerating, green - ready, green flashing - resin is being refilled into the polisher.
